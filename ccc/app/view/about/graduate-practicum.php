<h1>Graduate Practicum</h1>
<h3>Practicum Training in Counseling and Clinical Psychology</h3>
<p> Cook Counseling Center offers a two semester graduate practicum program, providing an excellent opportunity for clinical
	experience within a university counseling center and to gain skill in individual and group therapy with a college population.
	These are unpaid, training positions for students who are currently enrolled in graduate academic programs. </p>
<p> The primary focus of Practicum I (Group) and Practicum II (Individual) at Cook Counseling Center is on the development of
	clinical skills, however, there may be opportunity to gain experience in other aspects of college counseling practice, such
	as outreach. Practicum II doctoral students are expected to be on-site for a minimum of 10 hours per week. Practicum I students
	must complete a minimum of five hours per week.</p>
<p> To meet the training objectives, Practicum I students will be involved in a minimum of one group per semester. Requirements
	for Practicum I students include either process-observation or co-leading a group, and recording group therapy case notes.
	Practicum I students are also required to participate in a two-hour per week, group supervision meeting led by a licensed
	clinical psychologist. They will also receive additional, informal supervision from their group co-leader.</p>
<p> Practicum II doctoral trainees will see five to seven clients per week (master’s trainees may have a larger time commitment
	and caseload expectation as required by their academic departments) and/or co-facilitate a therapy group, completing progress
	notes for all cases and groups over the course of one academic year. Optional activities may include opportunities for consultation
	and outreach with student groups or faculty. If a Practicum II student elects to be involved in groups, participation in
	Supervision of Groups is required in addition to their minimum hours. Practicum II students receive one hour of individual
	supervision per week with a doctoral psychology intern, as well as two hours per week of group supervision co-led by a licensed
	clinical psychologist and a licensed professional counselor. Supervision sessions primarily consist of video and case review,
	as well as relevant discussion of theoretical and professional issues.</p>
<h3>Practicum Training in Clinical Social Work</h3>
<p> The primary focus of Foundation Practicum and Concentration Practicum for clinical social work students at Cook Counseling
	Center is on the development of clinical skills, however, there may be opportunity to gain experience in other aspects of
	college counseling practice, such as outreach. For the Concentration Practicum, masters level clinical social work students
	are expected to be on-site three days per week. For the Foundation Practicum for masters level clinical social work, students
	must complete a minimum of two days per week.</p>
<p> To meet the training objectives, Foundation Practicum social work students will be involved in a minimum of one group per
	semester or be involved with outreach and case management support. Requirements for Foundation Practicum students may choose
	between: 1) process-observation or co-leading a group, and recording group therapy case notes, or 2) co-leading outreach
	activities and providing case management support to Staff Counselors, and recording case notes. Foundation Practicum students
	are also required to participate in a two-hour per week, group supervision meeting led by a licensed clinician (clinical
	psychologist and a licensed professional counselor). They will also receive additional, informal supervision from their
	group co-leader.</p>
<p> Concentration Practicum students will see five to seven clients per week and/or co-facilitate a therapy group, completing
	progress notes for all cases and groups over the course of one academic year. Optional activities may include opportunities
	for consultation and outreach with student groups or faculty. If a Concentration Practicum student elects to be involved
	in groups, participation in Supervision of Groups is required in addition to their minimum hours. Concentration Practicum
	social work students receive one hour of individual supervision per week with a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, as well

<h1>Outreach</h1>
<p>Outreach and consultation services are an integral part of Cook Counseling Center’s mission of reaching out to students,
	faculty and staff through the provision of educational programming and workshops.</p>
<p>These programs and workshops are designed to enhance the learning and development of students, faculty and staff. Outreach
	services also include providing consultation when there is a concern about the behavior or well-being of a student. Programs
	that have been requested in the past include issues such as eating disorders, stress management, time management, healthy
	relationships, depression in college students, and orientation to Cook Counseling Center’s services.</p>
<p>Our staff members also work with faculty members who would like presentations or facilitation of discussions that address
	specific concerns of college students and complement their course content. The staff works with faulty members to develop
	programs specific to their needs while also offering programs for special, national events, such as National Depression
	Screening Day and Eating Disorder Awareness week.</p>

<h1>VCOM Medical Student Clerkship</h1>
<p>Our psychiatrists and nurse practitioners are committed to the important medical tradition of training students in the field
	of medicine. Clinicians in the psychiatry department are often on the clinical faculty of local medical schools, including
	the Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine and the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine. Third and fourth year
	medical students are occasionally connected to a clinician as their preceptor and will sit in on psychiatric evaluations
	and counseling sessions with the permission of the student who is being seen.</p>

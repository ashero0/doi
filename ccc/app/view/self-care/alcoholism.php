<h1>Alcoholism</h1>
<p> Alcohol abuse is one of the leading problems suffered by college students. Alcohol can have significant effects on feelings,
	perceptions and physiology. This kind of abuse can affect your personality, academic performance, relationships and your
	health.</p>
<p> If you feel that you may have a problem controlling your alcohol intake or have developed a dependency on alcohol, Cook Counseling
	Center urges you to seek help. We provide brief, individual counseling to students whose alcohol use may be impairing academic
	performance, as well as referral to more specialized treatment facilities for more serious substance abuse problems.</p>
<p>Another option for students is attending
	<a href="http://www.aa.org/?Media=PlayFlash"> Alcoholics Anonymous</a>. There are
	<a href="https://aavirginia.org/meetings/">daily meetings</a> throughout the Blacksburg area. Alcoholics Anonymous is a free fellowship where groups of people share
	their experiences while striving to help one another recover from alcoholism.</p>

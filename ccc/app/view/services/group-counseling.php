<h1>Group Counseling</h1>
<br>
<p>Group counseling is one of our primary clinical services. For many students, group therapy is the most
    effective and appropriate treatment option.

    Group counseling is a unique opportunity available to students in need of a supportive environment. It
    allows students to hear multiple perspectives and receive encouragement and feedback from peers in a safe
    and confidential environment. These interpersonal interactions deepen self-awareness and help members learn
    new ways of relating to others. While some of our groups focus primarily on deepening this understanding of
    self and others, we also have groups that focus on specific concerns and skill development.

    There is no limit to the number of group therapy sessions available to students. Getting started with group
    counseling begins with an initial evaluation, or intake appointment. You and your counselor will discuss if
    group counseling is the appropriate form of treatment. Your counselor will also provide information about
    our groups so you can choose the one that best suits your needs. Groups meet weekly for 60-90 minutes. There
    are typically 5-12 students in each group and 1-2 group leaders.

                <p>When people come into a group and interact freely with one another, they usually recreate those
                    difficulties that brought them to group counseling in the first place. Under the skilled direction
                    of a group counselor, the group is able to give support, offer alternatives, or gently confront each
                    other. In this way, the difficulty becomes resolved, alternative behaviors are learned, and everyone
                    develops new social techniques or ways of relating to people.</p>

                <p>During group counseling, people begin to see that they are not alone. Many people feel that they are
                    different because of their problems and it is encouraging to hear that other people have similar
                    difficulties. In the climate of trust provided by the group, people feel free to care about and help
                    each other.</p>

                <p>You can talk about whatever you feel most comfortable disclosing. You may benefit most if you talk
                    about what brought you to the counseling center in the first place. Tell the group members what is
                    bothering you and if you need support let the group know. If you think you need confrontation, let
                    the group know this also – it is important to tell people what you expect of them.</p>

                <p>Unexpressed feelings are a major reason why people experience difficulties in their lives and
                    interactions with others. Revealing your feelings – self-disclosure – is an important part of group
                    counseling and affects how much you will be helped. The appropriate disclosures will be those that
                    relate directly to your present difficulty. How much you talk about yourself is depends on how
                    comfortable you are. If you have any questions about what might or might not be helpful, you can
                    always ask the group.</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold">“I will be forced to tell all of my deepest thoughts, feelings and secrets
                    to the group.”</p>

                You control what, how much, and when you share with the group. Most people find that they feel safe
                enough to share what is troubling them – a group can be very helpful and affirming. We encourage you not
                to share what you are not ready to disclose. Listening to others will also help, as some of what they
                say might also apply to you.

                <p class="font-weight-bold">“Group counseling will take longer than individual counseling because I will
                    have to share the time with others.”</p>

                Actually, group therapy is often more efficient than individual counseling for two reasons. First, you
                can benefit from the group even during sessions when you say little but listen carefully to others. You
                will find that you have much in common with other group members and as they work on a concern you might
                learn more about yourself. Similarly, group members will often bring up issues that strike a chord with
                you, but that you might not have been aware of or brought up yourself.

                <p class="font-weight-bold">“I will be verbally attacked by the leaders and by other group members.”</p>

                It is very important that group members feel safe. Group leaders are there to help develop a safe
                environment. Criticism is often difficult for people to handle appropriately. As group members come to
                trust and accept one another, they generally come to view feedback and even confrontation as positives,
                as if they are coming from a best friend.

                One of the benefits of group therapy is the opportunity to receive feedback from others in a supportive
                environment. It is rare to find friends who will gently point out how you might be behaving in ways that
                hurt yourself or others, but this is precisely what group counseling can offer. This is all done in a
                respectful, gentle way, so that you can make the greatest use of everything you learn.

                <p class="font-weight-bold">“Group counseling is second-best to individual counseling.”</p>

                If group counseling is recommended to you, it is because your counselor believes that it is the best way
                to address your concerns. We do not put people into group counseling because we don’t have space in
                individual counseling or because we want to save time. We recommend group when it is the most effective
                method to help you. Your counselor can discuss with you why group counseling is recommended for you.

                <p class="font-weight-bold">“I have so much trouble talking to people, I’ll never be able to share in a
                    group.”</p>

                Most people are anxious about the idea of sharing with a group. Almost without exception, within a few
                sessions, people find that they do eventually talk in the group. Discomfort with speaking in a group
                setting is probably one of the reasons that your counselor recommended this method of counseling.
                Becoming comfortable speaking with others in a safe, group setting, may help your relationships with
                others and other aspects of your life.

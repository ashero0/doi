<p>Psychiatric services through Cook Counseling Center are available to any Virginia Tech student who has paid

    with a counselor.The counselor will evaluate your symptoms by performing a background screening and assessing
    the results. It is up to your counselor to recommend psychiatric services if they are needed, however, they may
    also recommend individual therapy, group therapy, or participation in one of Cook Counseling Centerâ€™s workshops
    (such as relaxation training).

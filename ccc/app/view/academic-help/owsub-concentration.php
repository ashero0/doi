<h1>Improving Concentration / Memory Workshop</h1>
<br>
<p>Concentration and memory work together, but one does not lead to the other. To concentrate is to direct your mental
    powers, or efforts, towards a particular activity, subject, or problem. Memory is the ability to remember
    information, experiences, and people. There are some specific skills that can be learned to enhance both
    concentration and memory. Practicing these skills is likely to improve one's success as a student.</p>

<p>Once something is stored in our brains, we never forget it. We may, however, have difficulty recalling the
    information. It is also possible that the information we are trying to recall was never stored. This program will
    help you understand the structure of memory and also suggest some skills you can use to try to improve your memory.
</p>

<p>Good concentration will enhance memory. If we only practice skills that improve our memory but never look at factors
    that enhance concentration, our efforts will only be marginally successful. For this reason, tips for improving
    concentration will also be discussed.</p>

<p>Improving memory and concentration can be challenging. If you want further information about strategies to use to
    improve these skills, review other sections of Academic Support for Students. If you have been trying to improve
    your memory and concentration but the strategies you're trying just don't seem to be helping as much as you would
    like, please contact <a href="<?=BASE_URL?>about/contact-us" target="_blank">Cook Counseling Center</a>.</p>

<h3>Concentration Basics</h3>
<p>There are two areas that are crucial to improving concentration: the study environment and structure for study
    sessions. These areas are broken up into several conditions. It is not necessary to fully perfect all of these
    conditions, but the more of them you implement, the more you are likely to be able to improve your ability to
    concentrate.</p>
<b>Study Environment</b>
<ul>
    <li>Distraction free</li>
    <li>Conditions that are conducive to studying (i.e. chair, desk, temperature, and lighting)</li>
    <li>Materials needed for studying bring present</li>
</ul>
<b>Structure for Study Sessions</b>
<ul>
    <li>Develop realistic goals for the study session</li>
    <li>Decide on the order that tasks will be completed</li>
    <li>Plan a reward</li>
</ul>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Now that you have assessed the quality of the three locations where you most frequently study, look
                    at the variables that make certain environments more conducive to studying than others.</p>
                <b>Distraction free</b>
                <p>Much study time is wasted by distractions like talking to friends, playing computer games, or
                    watching TV. Think about your last study period. How long did you try to study (time from beginning
                    to end)? How much of that time was actually spent studying? If there is a big discrepancy in your
                    response to these two questions, you may want to explore another study location with fewer
                    distractions. The result may be that it actually takes you less time to accomplish the same amount
                    of work because you are able to stay focused in another environment more easily. Another source of
                    distractions may be personal concerns, which can be more difficult to control. If you find that this
                    is your greatest study distraction, you may wish to talk with a counselor on campus to try to find
                    ways to reduce or resolve your personal concerns.</p>
                <b>Conditions that are conducive to studying (i.e. chair, desk, temperature, and lighting)</b>
                <p>The chair used for studying should be comfortable enough that you can sit for 45 - 50 minutes at a
                    time. Sitting at a desk or table that provides adequate space for your materials to be spread out is
                    important. The lighting in the room should not cause eyestrain and the temperature should be
                    comfortably cool.</p>
                <b>Materials needed for studying being present</b>
                <p>It's important to make sure that you have everything that you will need for a particular study
                    session present when you begin. If you're going outside your room to study, think through what you
                    will need with you to accomplish your study goals and take it with you.</p>

                <p>Another set of variables that contribute to the success of time spent studying are focused on your
                    structure for study sessions.</p>
                <b>Develop realistic goals for the study session</b>
                <p>Having a specific, realistic goal for all study sessions is essential. Expecting to accomplish too
                    much in the time you have leads to discouragement. Setting, and achieving, goals leads to a sense of
                    accomplishment. This is also critical for reducing stress and meeting deadlines. Underestimating how
                    long a task will take is likely to result in having less time to do another task, which causes
                    stress.</p>
                <b>Decide on the order that tasks will be completed</b>
                <p>This makes your study plan more specific. It's generally best to begin with difficult or boring
                    subjects. Your ability to concentrate will be highest when you begin studying and the task is more
                    likely to take less time if you are studying at your “best time of the day.” It's easier to find the
                    motivation to do things you like to do, even when you are tired or have less energy.</p>
                <b>Plan a reward</b>
                <p>Planning to reward yourself when you have finished your study session can be very effective for
                    helping you accomplish the tasks you need to do, but only if you use restraint and don't allow
                    yourself the reward until you've finished your studying for the day. Rewards might be things like
                    watching your favorite TV show, talking with a friend, going to a movie, or anything else you enjoy
                    doing. Make a list of the things you could use as rewards so you don't have to spend time thinking
                    about your reward each day when you are planning your study period.</p>

<h3>Memory Basics</h3>
<p>Creating conditions for better concentration is likely to improve the quality of your studying; however, it is also
    necessary to implement skills that will enhance your ability to remember the material you are studying.</p>
<b>Four skills that can improve memory:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Organizational skills</li>
    <li>Using your body</li>
    <li>Using your brain</li>
    <li>Including time for recall</li>
</ul>

                    Organizational Skills

            <div class="card-body">
                <b>Learn main ideas first, then details</b>
                <p>At the beginning of the semester, preview each chapter of your textbook to get an idea about
                    what you will be learning in the class. Prior to reading each chapter, preview that chapter
                    to gain an understanding of the topics that it will cover and what you will be expected to
                    learn. This will provide a framework for understanding the details you will learn as you
                    read the chapter.</p>
                <b>Make the information relevant</b>
                <p>Try to make connections between what you are learning in class and your everyday life or
                    future career. Making the information meaningful to you will make the information easier to
                    learn and remember.</p>

                <p>Connect the information you already know with new information. Creating associations also
                    makes information easier to learn and remember. Information is stored in our brains
                    according to a scheme. Creating these associations helps to fit the new information into the
                    schemes that already exist in your brain.</p>

                <b>Use your body and your senses to help build memory</b>
                <p>It has been said, "people remember 90 percent of what they do, 75 percent of what they see, and 20
                    percent of what they hear" (D. Ellis, 1997, Becoming A Master Student, 8th ed.). Learning actively
                    can involve your whole body. You can stand up and talk aloud as you study, using your arms, legs,
                    eyes, ears, and voice. Getting your body involved puts energy into the study process and makes it
                    less boring. Maybe you have already used this strategy when preparing for a speech; however, it can
                    work for learning other materials as well.</p>
                <b>Relax</b>
                <p>Have you ever been unable to recall information in a test situation, but an hour later could remember
                    the information with clarity? This may suggest that you were not relaxed during the test. Relaxation
                    allows more blood to flow to the brain and thus allows us to think more clearly. Our brains are
                    alert when we are relaxed and this will enable us to perform more effectively and efficiently.</p>
                <b>Use visualization</b>
                <p>The more visual you can make the learning process, the easier it will be to recall the information.
                    Be creative and use your imagination. Create mental images that you can associate with the
                    information you are trying to learn.</p>

                <b>Overlearn the material</b>
                <p>Short-term memory is not very effective in test situations. Our short-term memories have limited
                    capacities and do not respond well under stress. Long-term memory is much more reliable in stressful
                    situations and long-term memory has an unlimited capacity. Moving information from short-term to
                    long-term memory requires time, energy, understanding, and repetition. When you are studying
                    material, study it multiple times using different study techniques. Also, vary the order in which
                    you study the material. The "recency effect" says that we remember what we heard or learned to last
                    the best. The "primacy effect" says that we remember what we heard or learned first the best. If you
                    always study material in the same order, it is likely that you will be unable to remember the
                    information covered during the middle of study sessions, so it is important to study this
                    information first or last during different sessions.</p>
                <b>Adjust your attitude about learning</b>
                <p>If you find a subject boring or uninteresting, it will be harder to learn. If you are taking flying
                    lessons to become a pilot, you will tend to pay close attention to the instructor because learning
                    the material is very important for your safety. While classes do not present the same life or death
                    concerns, try to have a positive attitude about your classes – it will enhance your ability to
                    recall the information. If you believe something is going to difficult and think that you will never
                    learn it, it probably will be difficult to learn the material. Wanting to learn the material and
                    believing that you can, will contribute to the ease with which the material is learned.</p>
                <b>Practice multiple study techniques for each class</b>
                <p>Use a variety of study techniques to learn the material. If you are trying to learn how to solve
                    math or engineering problems, do the problem, talk yourself through the problem to ensure that
                    you understand how you got from Step A to Step B to Step C, and then review the process with a
                    friend. If you are trying to learn material from a chapter in a sociology book for a test, use
                    SQ3R to read the chapter, review your class notes periodically, write new terms on note cards
                    that you carry with you, and review when you have a few idle minutes. There are many techniques
                    that can be used for different classes. Using the same techniques is probably not the most
                    useful strategy for all of your classes, so it is important to decide what techniques to employ,
                    given the type of material you must learn for each class.</p>

                <b>Regularly plan time for review</b>
                <p>It's actually better if review methods vary. For instance, you can review your notes silently, read
                    them aloud and listen to yourself, write down main points from your notes, create ways to apply the
                    information, test yourself on your notes, or teach the information to a friend. Using various
                    methods for review will help you gain a deeper understanding of the material. More active (versus
                    passive) review methods will also help you retain the information more fully.</p>

                    connections between the information you are trying to learn and the information you already know.
                    So, if you are unable to remember something, brainstorm the information you do know that is related
                    to the topic. If two concepts are similar and you remember information about one of them, recall
                    this information and you may find that you are able to recall the information about the other. In
                    the learning process, try to create examples to help you recall information. If the professor used
                    examples in class, recall his/her examples. Making connections between the material you know and the
                    material you are trying to learn will help you recall the less familiar material when you need it.

                Take a moment to reflect on the strategies that have been offered for improving memory and
                concentration. Write down the strategies that you want to use over the next few weeks to try to improve
                your memory and concentration abilities. Pick only a few. Things tend to become overwhelming when trying
                to make lots of changes at one time, so choose a few that you find easiest to remember and practice them
                each time you study.

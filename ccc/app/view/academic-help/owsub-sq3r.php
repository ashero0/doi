<h1>SQ3R Improving Reading Comprehension Workshop</h1>
<br>
<p>Textbooks are often read in the same way that other books are read for pleasure – beginning with the first page of
    the chapter and reading to the end of the chapter, without stopping. While this method is fine for novels, it is not
    likely to result in the level of understanding and retention needed for most textbooks and the classes they are
    assigned to. SQ3R provides a different method of reading textbooks that will most likely enhance understanding and
    retention of material. It's not a quicker way to read a chapter in a textbook, but it is likely to reduce the amount
    of time you will need to spend studying the material immediately prior to the test. This result comes from more time
    being spent actually understanding the chapter while it is initially read. Study time then becomes deepening your
    understanding of the material.</p>
<p>Reading textbooks and comprehending their information is difficult. If you want further information about reading
    comprehension, review other sections of Academic Support for Students. If you have been trying to improve your
    reading comprehension but the strategies you're trying just don't seem to be helping as much as you would like,

                <p>This step helps you gather the information that is necessary to focus on the chapter and formulate
                    questions for yourself as you read. It’s not necessary to have answers to your questions at this
                    step in the process – answers will come later.</p>
                <b>Read the title</b>
                <p>This helps your brain begin to focus on the topic of the chapter.</p>
                <b>Read the introduction and/or summary</b>
                <p>This orients you to how this chapter fits the author’s purposes. It also provides you with an
                    overview of the author’s statement of the most important points.</p>
                <b>Read each boldface heading and subheading</b>
                <p>This helps you to create a framework for the chapter in your mind before you begin reading. This
                    framework provides a structure for the thoughts and details to come.</p>
                <b>Review any graphics</b>
                <p>Charts, maps, diagrams, pictures, and other visual aids are there to make a point. Publishers will
                    not include these items in textbooks unless they significantly add to the content of the text.</p>
                <b>Review any reading aids in the chapter</b>
                <p>This includes italics, chapter objectives, definitions, and study questions at the end of the
                    chapter. These aids are there to help you sort, comprehend, and remember the material.</p>

                <p>Now that you have surveyed the entire chapter and built a framework for understanding, it is time to
                    begin the reading process. This step and the next two, reading and reciting, are repeated over and

                <b>Turn boldface headings into one or more questions. Write those questions on the left third of a piece
                    of paper.</b>
                <p>As you read this section, you will be looking for the answer to your questions. For example, if you
                    are reading a book to help you improve your study skills and the heading is "Use a Regular Study
                    Area," the questions you might ask are, "Why should I have a regular study area?" and "Where should
                    my regular study area be located?"</p>
                <b>Why is this step necessary?</b>
                <p>When your mind is actively searching for answers to questions, it becomes engaged in the learning
                    process. This will help you remember and understand the information.</p>

                <b>Add more questions, if necessary</b>

                <p>A single question is probably adequate for a section that is only a few paragraphs long; however, for
                    longer sections, you may find that you need to add a question or two.</p>

                <b>Don’t get bogged down with the details</b>

                <p>Well-written textbooks often provide examples to further explain main ideas. As you read each
                    section, try to separate the details from the main ideas. Use the details to help you understand the

                <p>The review step helps to refine your mental organization of the material in the chapter and begin to
                    build memory – we learn through repetition. This step provides another opportunity for repetition of

                <p>No technique is useful 100 percent of the time. Now that you’ve learned another study strategy, it is
                    important to decide when to use it. Different study strategies work best in different situations.
                </p>
                <b>When should you use SQ3R?</b>
                <p>SQ3R is an excellent technique to use with textbooks that provide a lot of information and require
                    you to learn the material in depth. Textbooks in many disciplines such as biology, psychology, and
                    sociology fall into this category.</p>
                <b>SQ3R is useful with many textbooks – what textbooks is it less likely to be useful for?</b>
                <p>SQ3R is probably less useful with textbooks that focus on helping you solve problems, like with math
                    textbooks. In this case, the main emphasis of reading the chapter is on helping you solve math
                    equations. Focusing your energy on solving mathematical problems using the information in the
                    chapter is probably a better use of your time.</p>
                <p>SQ3R may be less useful for two other types of textbooks: beginning foreign language texts or texts
                    for English class. The focus of beginning foreign language texts is often vocabulary, verb tense,
                    and sentence construction. Books for English class may be novels, and the purpose of reading may be
                    focused more on the "big picture," rather than on the content of a particular section or chapter.
                </p>
                <b>Does it matter how the professor uses the textbook in class?</b>
                <p>If your professor is reviewing a lot of material from the textbook during class lectures, it is
                    probably well worth your time to read the chapters using the SQ3R method.</p>
                <p>If your professor uses the textbook as a supplement or reference to class lectures, you will need to
                    balance spending your study time solving problems, reviewing notes, or doing other class homework
                    assignments to fill the time that would be spent using SQ3R.</p>

                <p>Now that you've learned about SQ3R, the next step is to incorporate it into your study strategies.
                    You may want to begin by selecting one class for which you will use the SQ3R method to read every
                    chapter prior to your next test. Here are some additional strategies you may want to implement along
                    with reading the chapter using this method:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plan ahead and start early. SQ3R takes time and is not a strategy that can be employed or used
                        effectively the night before a test.</li>
                    <li>Plan to read each chapter before it is discussed in class. Doing this will make the class
                        lecture a review. It is also likely to help you to understand the material that is presented in
                        class on a deeper level.</li>
                    <li>Identify information in the chapter that you don’t understand. Plan to talk with the professor
                        after class or during office hours if you still don’t understand the material after it is
                        covered in class.</li>
                </ul>
				<p>Write out your goals for using SQ3R over the next few weeks and stick to them.</p>

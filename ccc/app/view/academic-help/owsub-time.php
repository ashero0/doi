<h1>Time Management Strategies Workshop</h1>
<br>
<p>In many cases, new students may not have had to manage their time efficiently in high school to ensure good grades.
    Whether this is because of being bright or not being challenged enough, these students are faced with a significant
    change when they get to Virginia Tech. Some students who received A's and B's in high school now receive C's and D's
    in college. Those receiving lower grades are probably no less capable than those receiving higher grades, but often
    their study skills, including time management, are less effective.</p>

<p>If you can identify with any part of the above paragraph, working on improving your time management may be beneficial
    to you and your grades.</p>

<p>On this page, you will be given the opportunity to assess where your time goes and make decisions about changes you
    would like to make that will help you use your time more effectively. There is no one right way to manage your time,
    however, it is important to get to know yourself so that you can make good decisions about how to use your time. We
    all have 168 hours in a week to use as we wish, but some people make better use of this time than others.</p>

<p>Developing good time management habits takes time and requires hard work. If you want further information about time
    management, you may wish to review other pages within Academic Support for Students related to time management. If
    you have been trying to improve your time management but the strategies you're trying just don't seem to be helping
    as much as you would like, please contact Cook Counseling Center.</p>

                <b>Record known class assignments including quizzes, tests, projects, and papers</b>
                <p>Recording your class assignments at the beginning of the semester creates a framework for your
                    semester schedule. It lets you know when you are likely to have high academic demands and when you
                    will have more flexibility for scheduling recreational activities.</p>
                <b>Record co-curricular activities, including work hours, meetings, social commitments, and out-of-town
                    weekends</b>
                <p>Recording co-curricular activities allows you to have a more accurate picture of how full or open
                    your schedule will be throughout the semester. These activities are important for providing balance
                    in your schedule.</p>
                <b>Remember</b>
                <p>It is important to update your semester schedule regularly. Assignment due dates change, assignments
                    are added, and activities are planned. Keeping an accurate semester schedule facilitates the next
                    step of this process: Assessing and Planning your Weekly Schedule.</p>

                <b>Make a list of what you have to accomplish during the upcoming week, including class assignments and
                    class attendance</b>
                <p>Being as inclusive as possible in your list of schoolwork that must be done for the week is essential
                    to making your schedule work. Everything takes take time, whether it's reading a chapter, working
                    problems, or writing an outline for a research paper.</p>
                <b>Include co-curricular activities, work hours, errands, exercise, meals and time with friends on your
                    list of things to do for the week</b>
                <p>Daily living activities and co-curricular activities are important and provide balance in your
                    schedule, but take time away from studying. Preparing dinner and cleaning up afterwards or attending
                    a student organization meeting can take as much time as reading a chapter in a textbook.</p>
                <b>Estimate how long each task will take</b>
                <p>This is an essential, but often-overlooked step in the time scheduling process. Activities take
                    different amounts of time, so, to effectively use your time, it is important to estimate how long a
                    task will take. It's better to estimate conservatively if you don't know how long something will
                    take. If you finish 30 minutes or an hour early, you can use that time however you would like, but,
                    if you haven't allowed enough time, you'll have to take time away from another task to complete the
                    one that is taking longer than planned.</p>
                <b>Identify the day that you will accomplish each task, keeping in mind the amount of time the task will
                    take and other things you must also do that day</b>
                <p>This facilitates the next step of this process: Making a Daily Schedule. By looking at your whole
                    week and realizing everything you need to accomplish during that time, you are more likely to avoid
                    missing deadlines. You can make adjustments throughout the week instead of suddenly finding that you
                    have a six-hour task with only three hours remaining before the deadline. Making your schedule for
                    the next week is a good activity for Friday afternoon or evening, before beginning your weekend.
                    Weekends provide the largest blocks of time for study, so if you will have a very full week ahead,
                    it may be helpful to complete some of the tasks on the weekend to decrease the time crunch during
                    the coming week.</p>

                <p>This should only take a few minutes because you can use your weekly schedule to create it quickly.
                    Write your daily schedule on an index card or a daily planner. Carry your schedule with you so you
                    can refer to it as needed and cross items off once they are completed. This last step provides a
                    sense of accomplishment.</p>
                <b>As you write out your daily schedule, assess your priorities</b>
                <p>Some activities must be done on a particular day while others may be optional for that day. You can
                    use the A, B, C system of prioritizing your tasks: A tasks must be done that day and C tasks are
                    optional, while B tasks are important but not as important as A's. Try to accomplish all of your A
                    tasks before moving on to the B tasks and finally the C tasks. This can reduce your stress level.

                <b>How many hours a week do I need to study?</b>
                <p>Most universities recommend that students study at least two hours outside of class for every hour
                    spent in class, although some recommend even more. Many students are taking 15 credit hours per
                    semester, therefore at least 30 hours of studying a week outside of class is recommended. Combining
                    the 15 hours a week in class and the 30 study hours outside of class, many students will need to
                    plan to spend about 45 hours a week on school.</p>

                <p>Here are some strategies that you may find helpful if your schedule is not working as efficiently or
                    effectively as you would like. When trying any new strategy, it is important to practice it
                    regularly and to practice it long enough so that you have a way of evaluating whether or not it is
                    helping. Tests are good ways to evaluate new study strategies. If you take a test and don’t perform
                    as well we you would have liked to, try a new strategy until you receive the results of the next
                    test you take to get an idea on whether the new strategy is working for you.</p>
                <b>Identify your most productive time of day</b>
                <p>Studying at the time of day when you feel best (whether that is morning, afternoon, or early evening)
                    will enable you to complete your assignments in less time. Research studies show that what we can
                    accomplish in 60 minutes when we're less fatigued will take as much as 90 minutes to accomplish when
                    we are more fatigued.</p>
                <b>Study difficult or boring subjects first</b>
                <p>Study subjects that are more of a challenge for you first when you are less fatigued. Save subjects
                    you like to study for later, when you are feeling more tired, but need to continue to study to keep
                    up with your work. It will be easier to find the motivation to study something you find enjoyable
                    when you are tired than for a subject you dread.</p>
                <b>Study in the same place every time</b>
                <p>Studying in the same place each day is like going to class in the same room. You begin to associate a
                    particular activity with a particular location so when you are in that location, you are able to
                    focus on the task at hand more quickly. Studying on your bed or in your bedroom is not advised
                    because you probably associate your bed and bedroom with sleeping, not studying. It's too easy to
                    take those 10-minute naps that turn into two-hour naps.</p>
                <b>Use the library</b>
                <p>Libraries are good places to study because studying is one of the only activities that people do in
                    that environment. If there are reasons you choose not to use the library, try to find another
                    location outside of your room that provides a good study environment and is relatively free of
                    distractions.</p>
                <b>Avoid distractions</b>
                <p>Many things can provide a distraction from studying if you are looking for ways to procrastinate.
                    Previously on this page you identified your top five time wasters. For the next few weeks, try to
                    find ways to reduce the frequency with which these distracters are interfering with your study time.
                    This might mean that finding another place to study would be helpful.</p>
                <b>Use waiting time</b>
                <p>If you use public transportation to commute to and from campus, there is probably some waiting time
                    involved. This is a great time to study pieces of information such as learning vocabulary for a
                    foreign language class or memorizing a chemical reaction sequence. Write this information on note
                    cards and carry them with you so you can study during your waiting time.</p>
                <b>Treat school like a full-time job</b>
                <p>Try to accomplish as many of your school tasks as possible within a concentrated period of time, such
                    as 8:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. If you use these hours for attending class or
                    studying, you'll have much more free time to spend with friends in the evenings and on weekends.
                    Your classes are likely to get the amount of attention they require as well. This doesn't mean that
                    you'll never need to study in the evenings or on the weekends – there will still be crunch times
                    when you will need to do more studying. However, treating school as a full-time job, and adopting
                    the hours of a full-time job, will probably result in better, more efficient management of your
                    time.</p>

                <p>Of the strategies that have been discussed, you may be doing some of them pretty well but there are
                    probably at least one or two ways you could still improve your skill in this area. Think about what
                    you've learned and write down the skills you want to work on during the next few weeks. Keep them in
                    a place where you'll be reminded of your goals frequently and practice them every day. </p>

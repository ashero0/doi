<h1>Improving Test Performance Workshop</h1>
<br>
<p>Test performance not only reflects how much you studied in the hours and days leading up to the test, but also how
    well you have been studying throughout the semester. This page offers a variety of study strategies that you can use
    from the first day of class to improve your test performance over the entire semester. You may find, as you read
    through this page, that you are already routinely practicing some of these skills, while there may be others that
    you're not practicing as regularly. It is encouraged that you identify one or two skills you would like to try to
    routinely incorporate into your study schedule.</p>

                <b>1. On average, how many hours per week is it recommended that you study for each hour you spend
                    in class?</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>1 hour</li>
                    <li>2 hours</li>
                    <li>3 hours</li>
                    <li>4 hours</li>
                </ol>
                <p>There is no right answer to this question; however, it is generally recommended that you spend two to
                    three hours studying outside of class for every hour you spend in class. For a three-credit class,
                    you are spending three hours in class every week. This would suggest that you should plan to spend
                    at least six hours outside of class studying each week. Obviously, some classes will be more
                    difficult than others and some will be less difficult. Study activities include reading the
                    textbook, doing homework assignments, reviewing notes, and studying for tests and quizzes.</p>
                <b>2. What strategy do you use for taking notes in your classes?</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Write everything the professor says</li>
                    <li>Write notes in an outline form</li>
                    <li>Write notes in a modified outline form</li>
                    <li>Copy everything appearing on slides</li>
                </ol>
                <p>One strategy for note taking that has proven to be very useful is the modified outline form, which
                    will be explained later on this page. It’s not possible to write down everything that the professor
                    says. People generally speak at a rate of 150 - 200 words per minute and can only write about 25
                    words per minute. While it may be useful to copy everything on slides, those are probably only the
                    main ideas of a lecture and additional information will be needed to effectively study for tests.
                </p>
                <b>3. When do you start studying for your tests?</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first day of class or the first day after a test</li>
                    <li>Two weeks before a test</li>
                    <li>A week before a test</li>
                    <li>Two days before a test</li>
                    <li>The night before a test</li>
                </ol>
                <p>While you may not actually label what you are doing as “studying for a test” until a few days or a
                    week before the test, everything you do from the first day of class or the first day after a test is
                    helping you prepare for the next test. Class attendance, note taking, reviewing notes, completing
                    homework assignments, reading the textbook, and reviewing notes and assignments prior to a test all
                    contribute to how you perform on the test.</p>

                <b>Connect class work to long-range goals*</b>
                <p>Some students love to learn just for the sake of learning, but many more need to believe that what
                    they
                    are doing in class has a purpose in the future. If you are one of those students in the latter
                    group,
                    try to apply what you learn in class to practical situations or your daily life.</p>
                <b>Become active and involved in learning*</b>
                <p>It is important to make learning an active process as opposed to a passive one. Making a learning
                    situation an active one requires that you actually process what you are hearing or reading. Put it
                    into
                    your own words to make the material more meaningful to you.</p>
                <b>Identify preferred learning style*</b>
                <p>Different people have different learning styles. Rita Dunn's classification of learning styles
                    includes:
                    visual, auditory, and kinesthetic/tactile. David Kolb and Bernice McCarthy identify learning styles
                    as
                    imaginative, analytic, common sense, and dynamic. It is important to try to identify your preferred
                    learning style and use that as much as possible in your study process. This will increase your
                    retention
                    of the material.</p>
                <b>Practice patience with the learning process and your progress*</b>
                <p>Learning takes time. Yes, there are students that seem to have a photographic memory and never need
                    to
                    study, but that is not true for most people. Students must learn how long it takes to learn
                    material,
                    while allowing adequate time for this learning to take place, to be a successful student.</p>
                <b>Use multiple methods for learning*</b>
                <p>We learn through repetition; however, that doesn't mean that we only need to study in one way.
                    Students
                    learn best by using a variety of strategies, including reviewing notes, making flashcards,
                    completing
                    homework problems, outlining chapters in the textbook, or studying in groups. The most effective
                    methods
                    used will vary depending on the class. </p>
                <b>Think about what is learned from the “big picture” perspective*</b>
                <p>It is important to learn not only the facts, but to understand how these facts fit into the bigger
                    picture. How do the facts you are learning apply to the chapter you are reading and the subject you
                    are
                    studying?</p>

                <b>Modified Outline</b>
                <p>A modified outline is helpful to use as you take notes during class. This requires leaving about
                    two inches on the left side of your page for questions, added during or after class, and taking
                    notes on the right three quarters of the page.</p>
                <p>As you take notes, write the topic on the first line and indent supporting details on subsequent
                    lines, using a separate line for each point.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Indent supporting details</li>
                    <li>Separate points on separate lines</li>
                    <li>Leave white space</li>
                    <li>Leave a wide left margin</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Abbreviations</b>
                <p>While taking notes, it may be important to develop abbreviations to help you jot down more
                    information quickly. It doesn't matter what system you use for abbreviations but try to be
                    consistent so when you look at your notes a few days after you've taken them, you still understand
                    what you wrote.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eliminate vowels</li>
                    <li>Use word beginnings</li>

                <p>Reviewing notes after class each day, or at least before you go to bed, will help you to retain and
                    recall more information. At the end of nine weeks, those who reviewed their notes within a day
                    recalled about 75 percent of the information. Those who did not review their notes were unable to
                    recall even 50 percent of the information after one day, and only a little more than 20 percent of
                    the information after nine weeks.</p>
                <p>We learn through repetition. When you review your notes, you may want to add additional information
                    you recall from class or add questions in the margins to help you study the material later. You may
                    also find that you don't understand some of the things you wrote, so you may want to ask the
                    professor or a friend in the class to get clarification.</p>

                <p>Read the chapter title, introduction, learning objectives, summary, and end of chapter questions.
                    Also review bold face headings and subheadings, graphics, and italics throughout the chapter. This
                    will provide an overview of the chapter and create a mental framework for understanding the chapter
                    more thoroughly as you read.</p>
                <b>Question</b>
                <p>Prior to reading each section, turn each heading into one or more questions. It will be helpful if
                    you write your questions down so you can refer to them as you move through this process. This step
                    helps one's mind engage and concentrate and creates an active learning environment.</p>
                <b>Read</b>
                <p>As you read each section, look for answers to your questions. This fills in the information around
                    the mental framework you have created in the previous steps.</p>
                <b>Recite</b>
                <p>After you have finished reading a section and before moving on to the next section of the chapter, go
                    back to your questions to see if you can answer them. If you can't, you may have missed the main
                    ideas in that section and may want to read it again. If you can answer them, you're ready to
                    complete this process for the next section.</p>
                <b>Review</b>
                <p>Review all of your questions to see if you can answer them. This step helps to refine your mental
                    organization and begin to build your memory and understanding of the material. Following this model
                    as you read chapters is likely to reduce the amount of time you will need to spend studying the
                    chapters the week before the test because you have already begun to learn and memorize the material.

                <p>We all have 168 hours in each week, but some people use this time more efficiently than others. As a
                    student, there are many demands on your time. These include the usual daily living demands, such as
                    sleeping, grooming, preparing and cleaning up meals, running errands, and earning money. In addition
                    to the hours required by these activities, being a full-time student requires as much time as a

                <p>Most universities recommend that students plan to spend at least two hours outside of class for every
                    hour spent in class. Therefore, if you are taking 15 credit hours, it is suggested that you spend at
                    least 30 hours a week outside of class studying and doing assignments for classes.</p>

                <p>If you have more than 30 hours a week available for studying and are using your study time wisely,
                    but are not obtaining the grades you would like, you may want to talk with a counselor about

                <b>About a week before a test, develop a test preparation plan</b>
                <p>If you've practiced some or all of the techniques discussed previously, you are well on your way to
                    being prepared for any test. It is important to decide how many hours you need to allocate for
                    studying, and how to break those hours up, prior to your test.</p>
                <b>Review notes, problems, and textbooks</b>
                <p>Include time for reviewing your notes, homework problems, and textbook chapters, as well as other
                    materials the professor may have provided. Begin each study period by studying different material
                    than what you studied first during your previous study period. Also make sure you are not always
                    studying the same material in the middle or at the end of your study period. The "primacy effect"
                    suggests that we will best remember material studied first. The "recency effect" suggests that we
                    will best remember material studied last. Therefore, always studying the same material in the middle
                    of your study period suggests that you will be less likely to remember it.</p>
                <b>Concentrate on the main ideas using learning objectives, study questions, and other chapter study
                    aids to help</b>
                <p>If test questions will be coming from the textbook as well as class lectures, use the study aides in
                    the textbook chapters to guide you. These aids were created to highlight the ideas the author
                    perceived to be the main points in the chapter. In many cases, your professor will probably focus on
                    these ideas as well.</p>

                <b>Take practice tests</b>
                <p>Professors may have old tests that you can use to test yourself on current material. If they do, this
                    is an excellent way to prepare for your next test. If you complete the practice test a day or two in
                    advance of your next test, you can focus on the material you missed on the practice test during the
                    study time remaining prior to the upcoming test.</p>
                <b>Use chapter headings, other chapter aids, your textbook, and class notes to develop your own test</b>
                <p>If your professor doesn't have old tests available, consider making your own test by using provided
                    and created aids. This will take time, but the may lead to performing better on your test.</p>
                <b>Create test-like conditions</b>
                <p>A critical part of self testing is to take the test under test-like conditions. If you will not be
                    able to use notes or your textbook during the test, don't use them when you take the practice test.
                    Also, try to do the practice test within the time limit you will have on the real test. In this way,
                    you get an idea whether or not you know the material well enough, or whether you need to spend more
                    time studying the material so that you can recall it more quickly.</p>

                <b>Arrive on time</b>
                <p>Arriving on time will help to avoid the "brain pickers," other students who ask you questions right
                    before the test to that you may or may not know the answer to. This can create needless anxiety.</p>
                <b>Do a memory dump</b>
                <p>If you believe that there will be a discrete amount of information that you will most likely need to
                    know on the test and you fear you may forget it, write it down on the test as soon as the test is
                    distributed. Then if you need this information, you have it available and do not need to rely on
                    your memory.</p>
                <b>Read directions carefully</b>
                <p>The directions for a test may seem obvious to some, but to others, there may be valuable information
                    hidden in them. Read the directions carefully to ensure that you understand what you are being asked
                    to do as you respond to the questions.</p>
                <b>Budget time wisely</b>
                <p>Quickly review the test before you begin and decide how much time you will spend on each part of the
                    test. Pay attention to the weight of each section on your grade and make sure you allow enough time
                    for sections that may take more time or are weighted more heavily in the final test grade. It's
                    never fun to arrive at the last page of the test only to find an essay question worth 25 percent of
                    your grade with only a few minutes remaining to complete the test.</p>
                <b>Feeling anxious? Practice relaxation</b>
                <p>A number of autogenic relaxation techniques can be useful during a test if you find that anxiety is
                    interfering with your performance. Some anxiety is good because it helps us perform better, but at
                    some point, the anxiety can reduce performance. If you are unfamiliar with autogenic relaxation
                    techniques, you may wish to talk with a counselor in your counseling center to find out more about
                    these techniques.</p>
                <b>Look for cues</b>
                <p>You can look for two answers that are similar, cues from other questions, grammatical matching
                    between the question and answers, as well as other strategies to give you a hint at correct answers.
                </p>
                <b>Answer all of the questions</b>
                <p>Some professors give partial credit, so it is important to answer all of the questions even if you
                    are running out of time and can’t answer them fully.</p>
                <b>Do not change answers</b>
                <p>Research has shown that it is best to go with our first instinct when choosing an answer to a
                    question, unless you are very sure the answer you have chosen is wrong.</p>
                <b>Use all of the time available</b>
                <p>If you finish early, go back and review your answers to make sure you haven't skipped a question or
                    made careless mistakes as you responded to the questions.</p>

                <b>What study strategies have you tried for improving your grades?</b>
                <p>There are numerous study strategies and no single strategy is likely to work best for all of your
                    classes. Strategies might include taking notes on chapters in the textbook as you read them,
                    reviewing your notes each day after class, reworking homework problems under test-like conditions,
                    or testing yourself on the notes you have taken in class. Experimenting with various strategies that
                    seem appropriate for different classes will help you decide which strategies work best for those
                    classes. Your learning style will also have an impact on the study methods that help you learn most
                    effectively. Some people prefer to study alone while others learn better in groups. Some people
                    learn through auditory means and benefit from talking aloud as they study. Some people are visual
                    learners and need to see what they are learning. Think about how you learn best and try to include
                    those learning methods in your study process as much as possible to enhance you learning.</p>
                <b>What strategy or combination of strategies have you used most effectively to prepare for tests?</b>
                <p>Just as there are a variety of study strategies, there are also a variety of strategies that are
                    useful for preparing for tests. It is important to know if you will be taking a multiple choice,
                    essay, or problem solving test because this will have an impact on the way you study. Study
                    strategies for multiple-choice tests may include reviewing notes after class each day, carefully
                    reading the textbook, taking notes as you read, and making flashcards with specific information you
                    are expected to learn. Studying for an essay exam might include reviewing notes daily, reading and
                    reviewing the textbook, trying to understand the "big picture," and making sure you can support
                    general ideas with specific points. Preparing for a problem solving test may involve reworking
                    homework problems, completing extra problems, meeting with a friend to talk through when to apply
                    different problem solving methods, creating your own test, or taking an old test from the professor
                    under test-like conditions to assess whether you know the material well enough to complete your
                    upcoming test within the time that will be allowed. There are many other strategies out there.
                    Finding strategies that work for you and allowing adequate study time to implement the strategies
                    for each class is key.</b>

                <p>Many college students arrive at college with inadequate study skills. Most students who go to college
                    were good students in high school and many did not have to study very hard to get good grades.
                    Finding that previous study skills are not working for the first time in a student's academic career
                    can be overwhelming. Choose one strategy at a time to practice. Work on it and, when you become
                    proficient, choose another skill to work on and improve.</p>
